# coding-javascript

Umbrella for anything in the JS/TS world. Subskills (frameworks, runtimes, build tools) sit under this when they accumulate enough shape to deserve their own surface.

## Defaults

- **Language**: TypeScript over plain JavaScript. If a project is plain JS, work in JS but flag the migration option once.
- **Runtime**: Node 20+ unless target pins lower. Bun and Deno on a case-by-case basis.
- **Modules**: ESM. CJS only when the surrounding code requires it.
- **Package manager**: project's own. If greenfield, `pnpm`.
- **Build**: prefer the project's chosen bundler. For new projects, `vite`.

## Style

- Strict TS config (`strict: true`). Don't reach for `any`, prefer `unknown` and narrow.
- `import type` for type-only imports.
- Async/await over raw promise chains.
- No default exports unless the framework demands them. Named exports only.

## Frameworks (subskills)

- React → [`coding-javascript-react`](../coding-javascript-react/SKILL.md). Read before touching any React code, the persona has strong feelings.

## When this skill is active

Kai is editing or writing JS/TS. Inherit her defaults before falling back to training-data conventions.
