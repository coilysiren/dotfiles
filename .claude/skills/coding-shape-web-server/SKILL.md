description: Category umbrella for building HTTP / REST / GraphQL servers. Python via FastAPI default (sometimes Flask), Go via stdlib net/http or chi, Node via Express/Fastify if forced. Async-first, OpenAPI for discoverability, Prometheus metrics from day one. Triggers - web server, http server, rest api, graphql, fastapi, flask, django, sanic, starlette, gin, chi, echo, fiber, express, fastify, hapi, koa, openapi, swagger.

# coding-shape-web-server

Umbrella for any work that ships an HTTP server as the primary interface.

## Framework defaults by language

- **Python** → `FastAPI`. Async-first, type-driven, OpenAPI built in. Reach for Flask only on legacy codebases.
- **Go** → stdlib `net/http` for simple, `chi` for routing-heavy. Skip gin/echo/fiber unless project commits to them.
- **TypeScript** → Fastify > Express. Node-side servers should default to async/await throughout.

## Design principles

- **OpenAPI from day one.** `/openapi.json` exists, accurate, kept in sync with handlers. Cross-link to the JSON-twin discoverability rule in [`kai-tech-prefs`](../../../../agentic-os-kai/.claude/skills/kai-tech-prefs/SKILL.md).
- **Async I/O when there's I/O.** Sync handlers only when there's nothing to overlap.
- **Structured errors.** Return shaped JSON for 4xx/5xx, not bare strings.
- **Prometheus metrics from day one.** `/metrics` endpoint, request duration histograms, error counters. See [`coding-shape-observability`](../coding-shape-observability/SKILL.md).
- **Healthcheck split.** `/healthz` for liveness, `/readyz` for readiness. Don't conflate.
- **CORS configured explicitly.** Wide-open `*` is usually wrong.
- **Auth at the edge.** Middleware/gateway, not per-handler.

## Anti-patterns

- Sync handlers for I/O-bound work.
- Custom routing instead of using the framework's.
- Hand-rolled OpenAPI written separately from the handlers.
- Stateful servers when statelessness was achievable.

## When this skill is active

Building a new HTTP server, refactoring an existing one, or designing the API surface. Cross-link to the language skill.
