# skillsmp Skill Discovery

Handle the full loop: notice a skill might help, search the marketplace, vet what comes back,
show the user the skill's public page, confirm before install, and drop the skill into
`<personal-os-repo>/.claude/skills/` so future sessions pick it up automatically.

## When to consider reaching for this skill

Read this broadly. **When a task sounds like "the kind of thing someone has probably written a skill for", check the marketplace first.**

Concrete triggers:

- The user explicitly mentions skillsmp, "the skill marketplace", or asks to "find a skill for ..." or "install a skill that ...".
- "Is there a skill for X?" / "does a skill exist for Y?" - answer by actually looking.
- "Can you ..." requests describing a narrow, specialized task that feels like a packaged capability: parsing a niche format, integrating with a specific API, a recognized workflow in some domain.
- **Reinvention check.** You (the agent) are mid-task and notice you're about to hand-roll something that sounds like a packaged capability - pause and check the marketplace before continuing. The 30-second search beats 10 minutes of reimplementing. Concrete shape of the moment: you're about to write a helper that parses ICS calendar files, generates QR codes, extracts EXIF metadata, converts EDIFACT, fetches OpenGraph tags - that's when to stop and run step 2. If search comes up empty, carry on and build it yourself; the point is to *look*, not to force a skill where none fits.

What NOT to trigger on:

- Very generic requests ("write me a function that adds two numbers").
- Tasks where a skill already exists locally (`<personal-os-repo>/.claude/skills/`) - use those first.
- Requests where the user has said "do it yourself" or "don't use external tools".

Before searching, scan existing skills in `<personal-os-repo>/.claude/skills/` - if a matching one is already there, skip the marketplace.

## The API at a glance

Base: `https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills`
Auth: handled by `coily skillsmp` (see step 1). The bearer token lives in AWS SSM at `/skillsmp/api-key` (SecureString); the wrapper fetches it per call through the audited shell.Runner, so the key never ends up in a session env var or the audit log.
Rate limits: **500 requests/day, 30 requests/min.** Budget accordingly.

Response envelope:
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... }, "meta": { "requestId": "...", "responseTimeMs": N } }
```

**Keyword search** - `GET /search?q=<query>&sortBy=stars` - returns `data.skills[]` with fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable identifier (slug-like, includes author/repo/path) |
| `name` | the skill's own name |
| `author` | GitHub org/user that published it |
| `description` | from the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter |
| `githubUrl` | full GitHub URL, usually a `.../tree/main/...` path to the skill's dir |
| `skillUrl` | public page on skillsmp.com - **the URL you show the user to inspect** |
| `stars` | **⚠️ stars of the *host repo*, not the skill** - see caveats below |
| `updatedAt` | unix timestamp string |

plus `data.pagination` (`page, limit, total, totalPages, hasNext, hasPrev`).

**AI search** - `GET /ai-search?q=<natural language>` - semantic search returning an OpenAI-vector-store-style response (`data.data[]`). Try if keyword search comes up empty.

**Skill detail** - no individual GET endpoint exists. The search response already has everything needed (description, githubUrl, skillUrl). Don't waste requests trying to fetch a detail endpoint.

### ⚠️ Caveats about `stars`

`stars` is the GitHub star count of the repo the skill lives in, not the skill itself. A skill inside a collection repo (`someorg/awesome-skills`) inherits the whole repo's stars, so a 30k-star skill from a massive collection isn't more vetted than a 50-star one from a focused repo.

Use `stars >= 5` as a weak first-pass filter to cull abandoned repos, but don't treat high stars as a safety signal. Real vetting happens in step 3.

## The workflow

The full multi-step skillsmp workflow (search shape, review shape, vetting checklist, install, commit conventions, marketplace fast-forward) lives in [`references/workflow.md`](references/workflow.md). Read it before installing a marketplace skill.
## On announcing the search

When you decide a task warrants a marketplace check, say so in one short sentence before searching - e.g., "Before I roll my own, let me check skillsmp for an existing skill." Lets the user redirect if they'd rather you just do it. Don't monologue about the decision process.

## Commit after install

The installed skill lives under `<personal-os-repo>/.claude/skills/` and is version-controlled. Per the personal-OS git workflow, commit the new skill directory directly to `main` and push after install. One commit per skill (installs are "purely additive").
