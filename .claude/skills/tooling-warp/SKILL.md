# Warp

The terminal on every host. Block-mode UI with left-side vertical tabs.

## Config location

Canonical files live at `~/projects/coilysiren/agentic-os/warp/`, symlinked into `~/.warp/`:

- `~/.warp/settings.toml` -> `agentic-os/warp/settings.toml`
- `~/.warp/tab_configs/startup_config.toml` -> `agentic-os/warp/tab_configs/startup_config.toml`

## Cloud-sync gotcha

`[account] is_settings_sync_enabled` is forced to `false` in the committed copy. If Warp's cloud settings-sync is on, it overwrites the symlink target on every settings-touch from any device, fighting the repo. The repo wins; cross-device sync is given up on purpose.

If a settings-pane toggle silently disappears the next time Warp restarts, suspect cloud-sync was flipped back on and check `[account]` in the file.

## Why Warp instead of a classic terminal

Two pieces, together. Don't regress either:

- **Block-mode terminal.** Each command groups with its output as a discrete block. Click any past block to copy, share, or jump back. Errors get a red gutter. Long output collapses. This is the main reason Warp exists.
- **Tab as session anchor.** Each vertical tab keeps its own cwd, scrollback, env, and running processes. Switching tabs is switching context, not re-typing it. Like browser tabs for shell sessions.

The unit of work is a block, the unit of context is a tab.

## Tab discipline

Kai's typical Warp session is 4-7 tabs, one shell per tab, no splitting:

- 1 plain shell (true blank canvas).
- 1 file viewer (running `bat`-wrapped reflexes, see coilysiren/agentic-os#57).
- 1 status watcher (running `watch -n 5 '<command>'` for health checks).
- 4 cloud agents (typically Claude Code sessions).
- Optional: 1 persistent `ssh kai-server` tab if homelab work is hot.

Panes are off. Splitting one tab into multiple panes is rejected as a navigation primitive; if a status display is needed, it gets its own tab. This is why `display_granularity = "tabs"` (not `"panes"`).

## Settings that must not regress

In `[appearance.vertical_tabs]`:

- `enabled = true` - vertical tabs on. The whole UX bet.
- `primary_info` - per docs, valid values are `{command, working_directory, branch}`. Kai rejected `working_directory` because she's in `~/projects/coilysiren/*` 95% of the time. Current value is settled in the UI; whatever it is, don't revert to `working_directory`.
- `compact_subtitle` - per docs, valid values are `{branch, working_directory}`, but `command` is also accepted (undocumented variant). Current value lives in the file and is settled.
- `display_granularity = "tabs"` - one row per tab, not per pane. Panes are off, see tab discipline above.

`primary_info = "process"` is NOT a valid value, even though it sounds plausible. Setting it logs `Failed to parse file value for setting VerticalTabsPrimaryInfo` then `Inhibiting writes for setting key appearance.vertical_tabs.primary_info` in `~/Library/Logs/warp.log`, after which the file's value for that key is ignored.

## Host portability

One line is host-absolute and will not work cross-platform as-written:

- `[general] default_tab_config_path = "/Users/kai/.warp/tab_configs/startup_config.toml"`

On Windows, this needs `C:\Users\kai\.warp\tab_configs\startup_config.toml`. Two options when Windows comes up:

1. Per-host override - leave Mac path in repo, edit Windows copy in place after symlinking (breaks the symlink-as-source-of-truth model).
2. Drop `default_tab_config_path` entirely - Warp falls back to a default new-tab. Re-add only if the named startup tab is needed.

Until Kai installs on Windows, leave the Mac path as-is.

## AI / Agent surface (the noise-cut)

Kai uses Claude Code for AI work; Warp is terminal-only. The master kill switch is:

- `[agents.warp_agent] is_any_ai_enabled = false`

Set this, the entire Warp Agent surface goes dark. Every sub-toggle (Active AI, Next Command, Prompt Suggestions, Autodetect agent prompts, Autodetect terminal commands, etc.) is gated by it.

The sub-knobs (under `[agents.warp_agent.input]`, `[agents.profiles]`, `[agents.knowledge]`, `[agents.warp_agent.active_ai]`, `[code.indexing]`) are kept set to `false` in the file as defense in depth. They don't have effect while the master is off, but they stop noise from leaking back if anything ever flips the master.

The one knob that resists file edits is `[agents] cloud_conversation_storage_enabled`. Warp rewrites `true` to it on every cold launch from cloud account state, regardless of `is_settings_sync_enabled = false`. To actually disable, toggle the corresponding option in Warp's UI. After that Warp will write `false` to both the file and its account state.

`[general] default_session_mode = "terminal"` is separate from the AI surface but related: it controls whether a new tab opens as a shell or as a chat surface. Keep at `"terminal"`.

Open question: whether Warp has a hard kill-switch for the agent-panel keyboard shortcut (Cmd+I or similar). Empirically the master kill switch is sufficient for getting the surface out of the way; the shortcut may still open an empty/disabled panel. Verify in the real UI when convenient.

## How settings.toml interacts with SQLite

Per Warp's docs, the app watches `settings.toml` and applies changes instantly. Empirically observed behavior matches:

- The file is the source of truth at startup. Warp reads it, applies values to in-memory state.
- When you change something in the Warp UI, Warp writes the new value back to `settings.toml`. Existing keys get updated in place. New sections get appended.
- A parallel SQLite store (`~/Library/Group Containers/2BBY89MBSN.dev.warp/Library/Application Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/warp.sqlite`, table `generic_string_objects`, keyed by `storage_key`) caches the same state. Both file and SQLite end up holding the same values after a UI change.
- The one observed exception is `cloud_conversation_storage_enabled`, which Warp rewrites from cloud account state on every cold launch regardless of `is_settings_sync_enabled = false`. Cloud account state is its own source of truth for that key.

For peeking at SQLite to debug a setting mystery:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\ Containers/2BBY89MBSN.dev.warp/Library/Application\ Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/warp.sqlite \
  "SELECT data FROM generic_string_objects ORDER BY id;" | grep -i <KeyNamePartial>
```

The `storage_key` is the SQLite name (e.g. `VerticalTabsPrimaryInfo`); the TOML path is the snake_case form under the corresponding section (e.g. `[appearance.vertical_tabs] primary_info`). Map between the two by grepping the Warp binary:

```bash
strings /Applications/Warp.app/Contents/MacOS/stable | grep -oE '[a-z_]+\.[a-z_]+\.[a-z_]+'
```

## settings.toml schema gotchas

Enums in this file are strict-validated against Rust enum variants in the Warp binary. Wrong values get a `Failed to parse file value for setting <Name>` error in `~/Library/Logs/warp.log` and an `Inhibiting writes for setting key <key>` follow-up, after which Warp ignores the file's value entirely. Recovery is to fix the value and relaunch.

Three places to find valid values, in order of trust:

1. **The docs** - [all-settings reference](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/settings/all-settings/) and [settings file overview](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/settings/). Authoritative for what's officially supported.
2. **The Warp binary** - grep for enum variants directly:

   ```bash
   strings /Applications/Warp.app/Contents/MacOS/stable | grep -oE '<EnumName>[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*' | sort -u
   ```

   For example, `VerticalTabsPrimaryInfo` resolves to `{Command, WorkingDirectory, Branch}` (serialized as snake_case in TOML: `command`, `working_directory`, `branch`).
3. **Set it in the UI and read what Warp writes to the file.** Most reliable but slow.

Note: some accepted values are undocumented (e.g. `compact_subtitle = "command"` is accepted by Warp but not in the docs). Trust the binary over the docs when they disagree.

## Inline rich rendering

Warp renders:

- Clickable URLs and clickable file paths in output (OSC 8 hyperlinks).
- Images via the iTerm2 inline image protocol. So `imgcat foo.png` shows the image in the block.
- Pretty-printed tables when output is structured (e.g. `ls -l`).

The `open` wrapper in coilysiren/agentic-os#57 routes image extensions to `imgcat` and falls back to `command open` for everything else. `chafa` is the universal terminal image/video renderer if Warp's native protocol doesn't cover a case.

Less sure: whether Warp renders raw markdown in shell-mode output (agent panel definitely does). Verify when relevant.

## Common edits

- **Theme** - `[appearance.themes] theme = "phenomenon"`. Other built-ins live under Warp's Settings > Appearance.
- **Font size** - `[appearance.text] font_size = 11.0` and `notebook_font_size = 14.0`.
- **Custom secret regexes** - `[privacy] custom_secret_regex_list` is a TOML array of `{ name, pattern }` tables. Patterns are detection-only (block redaction is off, see `[privacy.secret_redaction] enabled = false`).
- **Subshell auto-warpify** - `[warpify.subshells] added_subshell_commands` makes Warp render blocks for commands like `docker compose run` that drop into an inner shell.
